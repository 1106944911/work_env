# vim-perl

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/vim-perl/vim-perl.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vim-perl/vim-perl)

This is the aggregation of all the various Perl-related syntax and
helper files for Perl 5 and Perl 6.

# Installation

You can install vim-perl using

* [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and git submodules
* [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)
* [VAM](https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager)

They were all tested and work: please read the related documentation on the related sites.

The legacy method is to install just do a "make install" and you'll get the
.vim files all installed in your `~/.vim` directory.

# Getting Help

Any bug reports/feature requests/patches should be directed to the [vim-perl group](https://groups.google.com/group/vim-perl).

When reporting bugs in the highlighting of items, please include an example file as well
as a screenshot demonstrating the problem.

# FAQ

## Can you add highlighting for Moose, Try::Tiny, Test::More, SQL in strings, etc?

We have syntax "extensions" under the `contrib/` directory; you can find custom highlighting
for these sorts of things there.

## Curly braces inside of regexes/strings are considered when I use %

(See also [GH #86](https://github.com/vim-perl/vim-perl/issues/86))

Vim itself only considers double quotes in this scenario; the matchit plugin, however,
can deal with this scenario and vim-perl's files are set up to work with it should you
choose to use it.
