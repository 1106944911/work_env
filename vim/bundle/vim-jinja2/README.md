This is the latest version of the Jinja2 syntax file for vim with the ability to detect either HTML or Jinja.

There are two reasons I made this repository:

* The version of this vim addon is out-of-date on vimscripts.

* I wanted to manage this syntax file with vim-addons-manager or whatever other vim plugins managers there are.

The current version is the [2013-04-23 version](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2/commit/6b7c0c232ff8f9ee373e69c0e1ec0e345ea75816) from the official jinja repository. 
If you notice there is a newer version available please message me.

**If you have bugs or pull requests, please submit them straight to the [source](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2).** If the plugin is overzealous in detecting the Jinja syntax, send me the template it shouldn't have matched.
